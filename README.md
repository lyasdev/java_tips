This project aims to discuss some java API design and implementations tips (only java APIs, no Spring, no Hibernate....), 
it will be divided into parts(represented by packages) and each part will be divided into items.
I'll do my best to discuss one and only one thing per item, but sometimes, I have to discuss more than one in order to show similarities 
and differences between discussed subject. let's get started.
